 * Alice:
 * Hey Bob! Thanks for helping me check in that code. I learned
 * a lot from you today.
 *
 * Bob:
 * No worries! These protocols can be really tricky sometimes...
 * do you remember what we discussed today?
 *
 * Alice:
 * Yeah... wasn't it like the American Education Services
 * or Audio Engineering Society? I remember each of these
 * groups had around 128 members joining!
 *
 * Bob:
 * Not quite... but anyways, do you remember what the two
 * modes were?
 * 
 * IV: 
 * 0000000000000000
 *
 * Alice:
 * Yep! Elephant corn branches and cookie bread cream. You know me,
 * I have a huge sweet tooth.
 *
 * Bob:
 * Right... maybe your brain is on a little sugar high from all that candy
 * you were munching on.
 *
 * Alice:
 * By the way, where are you going to be going for the company shutdown?
 *
 * Bob:
 * I'm headed off to a place in Europe! It's really fancy, lots of water canals
 * and view points. It's going to be a blast. I'm trying to keep my location a
 * Secret though... it's the Key to not having to run into coworkers on my trip!
 *
 * Alice:
 * Ok ok, I won't ask you any more. Thanks again for teaching me all those weird
 * organizations today!
